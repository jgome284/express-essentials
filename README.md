# Express Essentials

Express is a powerful but flexible Javascript framework for creating web servers and APIs. It can be used for everything from simple static file servers to JSON APIs to full production servers. This project provides notes for express in the [express.ipynb](./express.ipynb) Jupyter notebook.

## Development Environment
This project is set up with a .devcontainer for use on Visual Studio Code. For more information reference [developing inside a container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) on VS Code.
